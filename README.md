# README-Generator

## Description
A README generator; automates the creation of README.md files with some user input.
This particular project is written completely in JavaScript and will hopefully allow for the creation of a README.md file in a variety of cases.

## Installation 
1. On the main page of the repository (repo), press the green button that says "Code"
2. Press either HTTPS or SSH
3. Copy the string of characters by clicking the clipboard icon immediately to the right of this string
4. Open your terminal 
5. Navigate to the location where you wish to clone the repo
6. Type `git clone (copied text)` 
7. Replace the part that says "(copied text)" with the string you copied from the repo
8. Press enter
9. The repo should clone to your local machine in a folder with the name of the repo 

## Usage
1. Open the folder containing the cloned repo with VSCode or a similar program 
2. Open an integrated terminal in the directory containing the clone repo
3. Type `node index.js` to run the generator
4. Answer the questions when prompted
5. Your README.md file will magically appear in the directory wherein the index.js file is located
